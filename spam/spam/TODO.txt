staff management -add delete and edit name
location management - is this hard coded or do we want to edit it via UI
                      I think actually hard coded - we can edit it from shell and the receptionist doesnt need to see this

staff location management - each staff has at least one location
each location has (possible) many staff - so the forign key goes into location, but we can restrict the many relationship to 1-1 with sqlalchemny things
#relationships might be broken - test


my vision:

{extend body block}

#use jinja templating to repeat this element for all staff
#use db querys and join statment to fetch this inofrmation
 __________________________________________________________________________
| staff member name | dropdown or other thing for location | edit | delete |

 #button click unfolds js for creation of new staff - same as above but the name is a text box not text
 #thinking of it the edit button could do something fancy with js to do inline editing - transformation of text chunk into text box for editing name
|add staff|
{end body block }
checks for drop down to make sure that there are no duplicate locations
button arrangement can be as you see fit
